# Week-2-Python-Problem-Solving-

ðŸš€ Excited to Share my Python Learning Journey! ðŸš€



I'm thrilled to share a notebook of  Week 2 of the "Python for Programming" course at the foundational level offered by IITM. This week was packed with insightful lessons and practical assignments that deepened my understanding of Python. I've compiled my practice assignments and graded assignment questions into a Jupyter Python notebook, covering the following key topics:



ðŸ”¹ **Variables: A Programmerâ€™s Perspective**

ðŸ”¹ **Variables Revisited: Dynamic Typing**

ðŸ”¹ **More on Variables: Operators and Expressions**

ðŸ”¹ **Escape Character and Type of Quotes**

ðŸ”¹ **String Methods**

ðŸ”¹ **Introduction to the if Statement**

ðŸ”¹ **if, else, and elif Conditions**



Working through these topics has been incredibly enriching, especially understanding how dynamic typing in Python enhances flexibility in programming and how various operators and expressions can be utilized effectively. The lessons on string methods and conditional statements have also been instrumental in enhancing my coding efficiency.



Iâ€™m eager to continue this journey and tackle more advanced topics in the coming weeks. This notebook serves as a valuable resource for revision and future reference.
